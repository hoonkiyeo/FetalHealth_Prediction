# Fetal Health Prediction

## Summary
The objective of
this project is predicting fetal health accurately based on
various features and classify it from the range of 1 to 3
(“Normal”, “Suspect” and “Pathological”). We used cardiotocography data set with 2126 fetal cardiotocograms
(CTGs) and 23 features. We applied kNN, Decision Tree,
Random Forest, and various ensemble methods and observed their performance (test accuracy). In addition, impurity based feature importance analyzed with Random Forest and boosting
algorithms to figure out the most important feature in the
process of prediction. As a result of the project, we found
that boosting methods (XGBoost and Histogram Gradient
Boosting) are the models that have the best performance
and MSTV (mean value of short term variability) is the most
important feature in the prediction based on XGBoost and
ASTV (percentage of time with abnormal short term variability) is the most important feature in the prediction based on Random Forest
